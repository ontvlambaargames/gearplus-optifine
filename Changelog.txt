The following changes have been made since the last update:
*Cat hats:

*Kitty cannons
- Now use the cat hat model to reduce pack size
- Now come in all different cat variants

*Top hats:
- Now inherit their texture directly from Minecraft, making them responsive to resource pack usage
- Monocle moved slightly more towards the player, so that it doesn't appear to float in front of the player (There was a little whitespace between the player and monocle)
- Now come in all minecraft colors
KNOWN ISSUE: If skins have a hat layer, it will render through the hat. 

*Fez hat:
